Public-health and biomedical decisions increasingly depend on converting genomic data into **actionable evidence**.  
I develop and implement genomic methods that bridge research and real-world use, spanning **culture-free TB sequencing and resistance prediction**, **respiratory pathogen surveillance**, and **vector and malaria population genomics**.

My work focuses on turning pathogen and vector genomics into **decision-grade inputs** for surveillance, intervention planning, and disease control—across both **pharma / real-world evidence** and **global health implementation** contexts.

**Applied across**
- **Pharma & RWE:** resistance biomarkers, genomic surveillance, post-licensure monitoring  
- **Global health:** national surveillance systems, vector control strategy, TB and malaria program support

## Portfolio: Selected Work

### Culture-free TB whole-genome amplicon sequencing

**Context**  
Tuberculosis sequencing remains slow and infrastructure-intensive. Culture-based workflows introduce significnt delay and are poorly suited to resistance profiling in high-burden settings, limiting timely treatment decisions.

**What I built**  
A tiled amplicon sequencing approach for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* that enables whole-genome sequencing directly from patient sputum, without an intermediate culture step.

**Why it matters**  
- Generates high genome coverage from uncultured sputum, from even highly metagenomic samples
- Shortens time from sample to drug resistance profile, and could enable treatment tailoring
- Supports scalable, programmatic drug-resistance surveillance

### RSV genomic surveillance in a hospital-linked system

**Context**  
With the rollout of RSV monoclonal antibodies and vaccines, the limiting factor is no longer the availability of interventions, but the ability to target them effectively. Local transmission dynamics and age-structured spread are poorly resolved by routine surveillance.

**What I built**  
An end-to-end RSV genomic surveillance system integrated with a major hospital network, linking viral sequencing with epidemiological metadata from routine clinical sampling.

**Why it matters**  
- Resolves fine-scale, local RSV transmission patterns  
- Provides age-specific insights relevant to mAb and vaccine targeting  
- Demonstrates a scalable model for linking clinical care and genomic surveillance

### Global migration and insecticide resistance in *Aedes aegypti*

**Context**  
Vector control strategies often assume geographically stable and genetically homogeneous mosquito populations, even as resistance spreads rapidly and intervention effectiveness declines.

**What I built**  
Population admixture analyses to resolve contemporary migration patterns and track the global spread of pyrethroid resistance alleles in *Aedes aegypti*.

**Why it matters**  
- Reveals extensive contemporary mosquito migration, explaining the rapid dissemination of resistance variants
- Shows occurence of admixed mosquito populations in African regions with the heaviest dengue burden
- Informs resistance management, insecticide policy, and intervention planning

### Malaria transmission network inference

**Context**  
As malaria transmission declines, elimination efforts increasingly depend on identifying who is infecting whom and distinguishing local transmission from importation—questions that traditional epidemiology alone cannot resolve.

**What I built**  
Genomic epidemiology methods combining wet-lab and computational approaches to increase variant calling fidelity and infer individual-level transmission networks for *Plasmodium falciparum*.

**Why it matters**  
- Enables reconstruction of transmission networks at fine scale
- Shows the independent transmission of multiple clonal lineages through the dry season
- Illustrates for the first time that genetic distance can be used for epidemiological inference in *Plasmodium falciparum*

## What I Build

My work centres on **operational systems**, not isolated analyses:

- End-to-end genomic surveillance pipelines (sample → sequence → insight)  
- Culture-free and rapid resistance diagnostics  
- Population-genetic inference for intervention planning  
- Scalable analytics for real-world and public-health data

## Where This Fits in Decision-Making

Across projects, genomics is used to support decisions such as:

- Faster treatment selection through resistance prediction  
- Improved timing and targeting of vaccines, mAbs, and vector control  
- Evaluation of program impact and surveillance effectiveness  
- Translation of genomic data into policy-relevant evidence
