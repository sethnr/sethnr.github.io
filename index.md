## Pathogen genomics, disease surveillance, and decision-grade real-world evidence

Public-health and biomedical decisions increasingly depend on converting genomic data into **actionable evidence**.  
I develop and implement genomic methods that bridge research and real-world use, spanning **culture-free TB sequencing and resistance prediction**, **respiratory pathogen surveillance**, and **vector and malaria population genomics**.

My work focuses on turning pathogen and vector genomics into **decision-grade inputs** for surveillance, intervention planning, and disease control—across both **pharma / real-world evidence** and **global health implementation** contexts.

**Applied across**
- **Pharma & RWE:** resistance biomarkers, genomic surveillance, post-licensure monitoring  
- **Global health:** national surveillance systems, vector control strategy, TB and malaria program support

## Portfolio: Selected Work

### Culture-free TB whole-genome amplicon sequencing

**Context**  
Tuberculosis sequencing remains slow and infrastructure-intensive. Culture-based workflows introduce significnt delay and are poorly suited to resistance profiling in high-burden settings, limiting timely treatment decisions.

**What I built**  
A **tiled whole-genome amplicon sequencing** approach for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* that enables sequencing and resistance prediction **directly from patient sputum**, without a culture step.

**Why it matters**  
- Shortens time from sample to resistance profile  
- Enables sequencing where culture capacity is limited  
- Supports scalable, programmatic drug-resistance surveillance

### RSV genomic surveillance in a hospital-linked system

**Context**  
With the rollout of RSV monoclonal antibodies and vaccines, the limiting factor is no longer the availability of interventions, but the **ability to target them effectively**. Local transmission dynamics and age-structured spread are poorly resolved by routine surveillance.

**What I built**  
An end-to-end RSV genomic surveillance system integrated with a major hospital network, linking viral sequencing with epidemiological metadata from routine clinical sampling.

**Why it matters**  
- Resolves fine-scale, local RSV transmission patterns  
- Provides age-specific insights relevant to mAb and vaccine targeting  
- Demonstrates a scalable model for linking clinical care and genomic surveillance

### Global migration and insecticide resistance in *Aedes aegypti*

**Context**  
Vector control strategies often assume geographically stable mosquito populations, even as resistance spreads rapidly and intervention effectiveness declines.

**What I built**  
Population genomic analyses to resolve **contemporary migration patterns** and track the global spread of **pyrethroid resistance alleles** in *Aedes aegypti*.

**Why it matters**  
- Reveals extensive international mosquito movement  
- Explains rapid dissemination of resistance variants  
- Informs resistance management, insecticide policy, and intervention planning

### Malaria transmission network inference

**Context**  
As malaria transmission declines, elimination efforts increasingly depend on identifying **who is infecting whom** and distinguishing local transmission from importation—questions that traditional epidemiology alone cannot resolve.

**What I built**  
Genomic epidemiology methods combining wet-lab and computational approaches to infer **individual-level transmission networks** for *Plasmodium falciparum*.

**Why it matters**  
- Enables reconstruction of transmission networks at fine scale  
- Supports evaluation of intervention impact  
- Provides tools for targeting control efforts in elimination settings

## What I Build

My work centres on **operational systems**, not isolated analyses:

- End-to-end genomic surveillance pipelines (sample → sequence → insight)  
- Culture-free and rapid resistance diagnostics  
- Population-genetic inference for intervention planning  
- Scalable analytics for real-world and public-health data

---

## Where This Fits in Decision-Making

Across projects, genomics is used to support decisions such as:

- Faster treatment selection through resistance prediction  
- Improved timing and targeting of vaccines, mAbs, and vector control  
- Evaluation of program impact and surveillance effectiveness  
- Translation of genomic data into policy-relevant evidence

I’m interested in roles and collaborations spanning **pharma / biotech**, **real-world evidence**, and **global health**, particularly where genomics informs real-world decisions.
